# Image Classification on CIFAR-10 Using ANN & CNN

## Overview  
This project focuses on **image classification** using the **CIFAR-10 dataset**. Two different models were trained:  

- **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**  
- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**  

The goal was to compare their performance in classifying **10 categories** of images.  

## Steps  
1. **Data Preprocessing** â€“ Normalization and one-hot encoding.  
2. **Model Training** â€“ Trained both **ANN** and **CNN** models.  
3. **Evaluation** â€“ Compared accuracy and loss of both models.  
4. **Results** â€“ **CNN** outperformed **ANN** in image classification.  

## Libraries Used     
- TensorFlow/Keras  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  

## Results  
- **CNN achieved higher accuracy** due to its ability to extract spatial features.  
- **ANN struggled** with image classification compared to CNN.
